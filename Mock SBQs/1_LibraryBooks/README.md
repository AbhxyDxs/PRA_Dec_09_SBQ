# Library System

## Beans
1. **Book**  
   - `String title`  
   - `String author`  
   - `int pages`  

2. **Library**  
   - `String libraryName`  
   - `List<Book> books`  

## Problem
1. Dynamically create a list of `Book` objects and add them to a `Library`.  
2. Write two functions:  
   - **Function 1:** Find and display all books in the library written by a particular author (take the author's name dynamically).  
   - **Function 2:** Sort the books in a particular library by the number of pages in ascending order and display the sorted list.
